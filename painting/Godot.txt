Okay, here's a dialogue between Godot, Pozzo, and Lucky, attempting to 
capture the tone and absurdity of "Waiting for Godot." 
Note that Godot's lines are likely to be cryptic and inconsistent with the 
established character of Godot in Beckett's play, as he never actually 
appears. This assumes Godot has, for some reason, arrived.

Setting: A bare stage, perhaps with a single, withered tree like in 
Beckett's play.
Pozzo is still leading Lucky on a rope.

Characters:

    Godot: An imposing, perhaps slightly dishevelled figure. His presence 
	is unsettling.
    Pozzo: Loud, domineering, and obsessed with appearances.
    Lucky: Exhausted, burdened, and mostly silent, except when commanded
	to "Think!"

(Scene opens with Godot standing center stage. Pozzo and Lucky enter, 
Pozzo cracking his whip.)

Pozzo: (Booming) On! On, you cur! Move, I say! Godot, isn't it? A pleasure,
 a distinct pleasure! Though I confess, the pleasure is almost too much to
 bear! Heh!

Godot: (Slowly, deliberately) Bear. A heavy burden. Like the stones that 
bind the echoes.

Pozzo: Echoes, indeed! Echoes of what, pray tell? My brilliant wit, 
no doubt! (Chuckles loudly, then coughs) Lucky! Pig, give me a stool.

(Lucky shuffles forward, groaning slightly, and sets down a folding stool.
 Pozzo collapses onto it with a dramatic sigh.)

Pozzo: Ah, comfort, fleeting comfort! Is it time yet, Godot? Time for what? 
I can't quite recall. An appointment, a rendezvous?

Godot: Time forgets. Or perhaps, time remembers only what it chooses to 
forget. The forgetting is the remembering.

Pozzo: (Confused) Muddled! Utterly muddled! Lucky! Do you understand this 
man?

(Lucky stares blankly ahead, his mouth slightly agape.)

Pozzo: Of course not. He's a pig, I tell you, a veritable pig! Lucky! 
Dance!

(Lucky hesitates, then begins a jerky, pathetic dance. He stumbles and 
nearly falls.)

Godot: The dance of the damned. Each step a fall, each fall a preparation.

Pozzo: (Waving his hand dismissively) Nonsense! It's a performance! Art! 
Raw, untamed art! (To Lucky) Faster! Faster, you miserable excuse for a… for
 a…thing!

(Lucky's dance becomes more frenzied and desperate.)

Godot: Desperate. Yes. The only true movement is toward desperation.

Pozzo: (Annoyed) Are you always so…obtuse? I invited you here for 
conversation, not philosophical drivel! (To Lucky) Stop! Stop, you'll kill
 yourself!

(Lucky collapses, panting, at Pozzo's feet.)

Pozzo: Useless! Absolutely useless! Godot, are you going soon? This is 
frankly boring!

Godot: Going? Where does one go from here? There is only here. And the 
waiting.

Pozzo: Waiting! Exactly! Waiting for what? For whom?! Lucky! Think!

(Lucky, seemingly triggered, begins to murmur incoherently, building into a 
rapid, nonsensical stream of words: "…stones…time…forgetting…remembering…
fall…desperation…waiting…whom…why…stones…")

Pozzo: (Putting his hands over his ears) Stop it! Stop that infernal noise! 
Lucky! Be quiet!

(Lucky continues his torrent of words, oblivious.)

Godot: The truth speaks, even in madness. Especially in madness.

(Pozzo pulls out a heavy club and strikes Lucky over the head. Lucky 
collapses, silent.)

Pozzo: (Breathing heavily) There. Silence. Blessed silence. Godot, are you 
satisfied?

Godot: Satisfied? A word without substance. Like hope.

(Godot stares at Pozzo, an unreadable expression on his face. Pozzo shifts 
uncomfortably.)

Pozzo: Well, I… I must be going. Yes, going. Things to do, people to see.
 Lucky! Get up!

(Pozzo struggles to lift Lucky. He pulls him roughly to his feet.)

Pozzo: Good day, Godot. A… a most stimulating encounter. Though I still
 have no idea what you're talking about. On, Lucky!

(Pozzo drags Lucky offstage, cracking his whip. Godot remains, standing 
motionless, center stage.)

Godot: (Whispering) Waiting. Always… waiting.

(The stage fades to black.)
